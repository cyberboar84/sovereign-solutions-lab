In *The Great Gatsby*, F. Scott Fitzgerald's central thesis is a critique of the American Dream and its elusive nature, which is embodied through key metaphors such as the green light, the valley of ashes, and Dr. T.J. Eckleburg's eyes. The green light flickers across the bay, representing the elusive future, as well as the allure and futility of Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy. The valley of ashes is a desolate industrial wasteland that contrasts sharply with the wealthy communities, critiquing the moral and social decay caused by capitalism. Dr. Eckleburg's eyes, positioned on a faded billboard, are a silent, judgmental presence that emphasizes the spiritual decay and moral emptiness brought about by materialism.

Through these symbols, Fitzgerald explores the corrosive effects of class, identity, and wealth. The green light transforms from a symbol of hope into one of disappointment, reflecting Gatsby's tragic awareness that his dreams are irretrievable. The valley of ashes and Dr. Eckleburg's eyes further emphasize the social chasm and the lack of divine judgment in a world consumed by materialism. With remarkable skill, Fitzgerald uses these metaphors to underscore the folly of pursuing a constantly receding ideal. The novel ends with Gatsby's death, leaving a moral vacuum and a sense of inevitable return to the past. Fitzgerald's critique of the American Dream and his portrayal of a society that has lost its way provide profound insights.
