In F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*, the central thesis revolves around the critique of the American Dream and its elusiveness, as encapsulated through key metaphors such as the green light, the Valley of Ashes, and the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. The green light across the water symbolizes the unattainable future, representing both the allure and the futility of Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy and the broader illusion of social mobility. The Valley of Ashes, a desolate industrial wasteland, contrasts with the opulence of the wealthy communities, critiquing the moral and social decay perpetuated by capitalism. The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, situated on a faded billboard, serve as a silent, judgmental presence, underscoring the moral emptiness and spiritual decay of the Jazz Age.

Through these motifs, Fitzgerald explores themes of class, identity, and the corrupting influence of wealth. The green light evolves from a symbol of hope to one of disillusionment, mirroring Gatsby's tragic realization that his aspirations are irretrievably lost. The Valley of Ashes and the eyes of Eckleburg further emphasize the societal divide and the absence of divine judgment in a world consumed by materialism. Ultimately, the novel concludes with the death of the American Dream, as embodied by Gatsby's demise, leaving behind a sense of moral vacancy and the inevitability of being pulled back into the past. Fitzgerald's masterful use of these metaphors underscores the futility of chasing an ideal that perpetually recedes, offering a poignant critique of a society that has lost sight of its founding ideals.
