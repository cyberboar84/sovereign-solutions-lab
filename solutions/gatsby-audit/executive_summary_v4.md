F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* critiques the American Dream as an illusion through its rich symbolic architecture, which underscores the moral and social decay of the Jazz Age. Central metaphors like the green light, Valley of Ashes, Eckleburg eyes, uncut books, defunct clock, and yellow car reveal the disintegration of aspiration and the emptiness of wealth. The green light symbolizes the elusive promise of the American Dream, perpetually receding as Gatsby pursues Daisy, embodying both longing and futility. The Valley of Ashes, with its moral decay and industrial waste, contrasts with the opulence of West Egg and East Egg, highlighting class stratification and ethical neglect. The Eckleburg eyes, a faded billboard, serve as a silent moral judge, critiquing the spiritual vacancy of the elite. Gatsby's uncut books and defunct clock symbolize the performative nature of wealth and the futility of recapturing the past. The yellow car, a symbol of excess, becomes an instrument of tragedy, foreshadowing Gatsby's demise. The novel's tragic arc culminates in Gatsby's death, a "holocaust" of his illusions, exposing the moral indifference of the privileged. Ultimately, the metaphor of boats against the current underscores the inevitability of regression, revealing the American Dream as an unattainable illusion.
