F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" criticizes the illusoriness of the American Dream through its rich symbolic structure, highlighting the moral and social decay of the Jazz Age. Core metaphors such as the green light, the Valley of Ashes, Doctor T.J. Eckleburg's eyes, the uncut books, the discarded clock, and the yellow car reveal the disintegration of longing and the emptiness of wealth. The green light symbolizes the elusive promise of the American Dream, which constantly recedes as Gatsby pursues Daisy, embodying both longing and futility. The Valley of Ashes, with its moral decay and industrial wasteland, contrasts with the luxury of the West Egg and East Egg, highlighting class stratification and moral neglect. Doctor T.J. Eckleburg's eyes, a faded billboard, serve as a silent moral judge, criticizing the spiritual emptiness of the elite. Gatsby's uncut books and discarded clock symbolize the performative nature of wealth and the futility of recapturing the past. The yellow car, a symbol of excess, becomes an instrument of tragedy, foreshadowing Gatsby's death. The novel's tragic arc ends with Gatsby's death, the "massacre" of his illusions, exposing the moral apathy of the privileged class. Ultimately, the metaphor of the boat against the current emphasizes the inevitability of degeneration, revealing the American Dream as an unattainable illusion.
