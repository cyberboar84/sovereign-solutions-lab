**Execution Summary**

F·Scott Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_ is a sharp criticism of American dream, using rich metaphors to explore themes of illusion, stratification and moral decay. The novel's core is the green light on the water surface, symbolizing the American dream's elusive promise. Gatsby's relentless pursuit of this lamp — as well as Daisy — represents the constantly retreating desire target, reflecting the Jazz Age's broader social disillusionment. The green light embodies both the enticing possibility of transcendence and the cruel inevitability of its elusiveness.

The Valley of Ashes is a desolate and barren land between West Egg and New York, forming a stark contrast with the Jazz Age's luxury. This moral and physical landscape dominated by Doctor T.J. Eckleburg's eyes, highlights the spiritual decay and industrial entropy behind capitalist excesses. These silent but all-knowing eyes judge the moral decay of characters and society, highlighting the disconnection between material wealth and moral responsibility.

Gatsby's library filled with uncut books further criticizes the performative nature of wealth and identity. These books, like Gatsby's persona, are carefully constructed illusions, revealing the tension between authenticity and hypocrisy. This theme is echoed in the broken clock on the mantelpiece, symbolizing the futility of recapturing the past and the inevitability of time passing.

The yellow car as a symbol of luxury and excess becomes a tool of death, foreshadowing the tragic consequences of unrestrained consumerism. The hottest day of the year becomes a metaphor for the underlying tension and hypocrisy beneath the characters' glamorous appearances, stripping away deception and revealing naked truth. Gatsby's death is likened to a massacre, highlighting the moral emptiness and indifference of the privileged class, criticizing the systemic failure of a society that prioritizes materialism over humanity.

Ultimately, the metaphor of the boat going against the current summarizes the futility of struggling against the past. The green light, once a beacon of hope, becomes an unattainable illusion, reflecting the broader disillusionment with the American dream. Fitzgerald's novel is a powerful indictment of the vulnerability of social mobility and the enduring power of class stratification, offering a disturbing critique of the moral and spiritual decay of the Jazz Age.
