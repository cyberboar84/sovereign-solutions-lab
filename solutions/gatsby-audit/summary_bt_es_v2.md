**Executive Summary**

*The Great Gatsby* of F. Scott Fitzgerald is a biting criticism to the American Dream, employing a rich tapestry of metaphors to explore themes of illusion, class stratification and moral decadence. Central to the novel is the green light to the other side of the water, symbolizing the elusive promise of the American Dream. The tireless search of Gatsby of this light—and of Daisy—represents the aspirational horizon that perpetually moves away, reflecting the broader social disillusionment of the Jazz Age. The green light embodies as much the tempting possibility of transcendence as the crushing inevitability of its elusiveness.

The Valley of Ashes, a desolate wasteland between the comfortable communities of West Egg and New York, serves as a marked counterpoint to the opulence of the Jazz Age. This moral and physical landscape, dominated by the unchanging eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, underlines the spiritual decadence and industrial entropy that sustain the excesses of capitalism. The eyes, silent but omniscient, judge the moral decadence of the characters and society, highlighting the disconnection between material wealth and ethical responsibility.

The library of Gatsby, with its unopened books, criticizes even more the performative nature of wealth and identity. The books, like Gatsby's personality, are meticulously constructed illusions, revealing the tension between authenticity and artifice. This theme is echoed in the broken clock on the mantelpiece, which symbolizes the uselessness of recapturing the past and the inevitability of the passage of time.

The yellow car, a symbol of opulence and excess, becomes an instrument of death, presaging the tragic consequences of unbridled consumerism. The hottest day of the year serves as a metaphor for the latent tensions beneath the polished veneer of the characters, stripping away the deception and revealing crude truths. The death of Gatsby, compared to a holocaust, underlines the moral emptiness and indifference of the privileged class, criticizing the systemic failure of a society that values materialism over humanity.

Ultimately, the metaphor of boats against the current encapsulates the uselessness of striving against the past. The green light, once a beacon of hope, becomes an unattainable illusion, reflecting the broader disillusionment with the American Dream. Fitzgerald's novel is a powerful indictment of the fragility of social mobility and the lasting power of class divisions, offering a disturbing criticism of the moral and spiritual decadence of the Jazz Age.
