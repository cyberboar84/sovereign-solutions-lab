In "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the central thesis revolves around the critique of the American Dream and its unattainability, encapsulated through key metaphors such as the green light, the Valley of Ashes, and the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. The green light across the water symbolizes the unattainable future, representing both the allure and futility of Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy and the broader illusion of social mobility. The Valley of Ashes, a desolate industrial wasteland, contrasts with the opulence of wealthy communities, criticizing the moral and social decay perpetuated by capitalism. The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, located on a faded billboard, serve as a silent and judging presence, underscoring the moral emptiness and spiritual decay of the Jazz Age.

Through these motifs, Fitzgerald explores themes of class, identity, and the corrupting influence of wealth. The green light evolves from a symbol of hope to one of disillusionment, reflecting Gatsby's tragic realization that his aspirations are irrevocably lost. The Valley of Ashes and Eckleburg's eyes further emphasize the social divide and the absence of divine judgment in a world consumed by materialism. Ultimately, the novel concludes with the death of the American Dream, embodied in Gatsby's death, leaving behind a sense of moral emptiness and the inevitability of being dragged back into the past. Fitzgerald's masterful use of these metaphors underscores the futility of pursuing an ideal that perpetually recedes, offering a penetrating critique of a society that has lost sight of its foundational ideals.
