The *Gran Gatsby* of F. Scott Fitzgerald criticizes the American Dream as an illusion through its rich symbolic architecture, which underlines the moral and social decadence of the Jazz Era. Central metaphors like the green light, the Valley of Ashes, the eyes of Eckleburg, the uncut books, the broken clock and the yellow car reveal the disintegration of aspiration and the emptiness of wealth. The green light symbolizes the elusive promise of the American Dream, which perpetually moves away while Gatsby pursues Daisy, embodying both longing and uselessness. The Valley of Ashes, with its moral decadence and industrial waste, contrasts with the opulence of West Egg and East Egg, highlighting class stratification and ethical neglect. The eyes of Eckleburg, a discolored billboard, serve as a silent moral judge, criticizing the spiritual emptiness of the elite. Gatsby's uncut books and broken clock symbolize the performative nature of wealth and the uselessness of recapturing the past. The yellow car, a symbol of excess, becomes an instrument of tragedy, foreshadowing Gatsby's death. The tragic arc of the novel culminates in Gatsby's death, a "holocaust" of his illusions, exposing the moral indifference of the privileged. Ultimately, the metaphor of the boats against the current underlines the inevitability of regression, revealing the American Dream as an unattainable illusion.
