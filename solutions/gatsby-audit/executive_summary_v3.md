**Executive Summary**

F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* is a searing critique of the American Dream, employing a rich tapestry of metaphors to explore themes of illusion, class stratification, and moral decay. Central to the novel is the green light across the water, symbolizing the elusive promise of the American Dream. Gatsby’s relentless pursuit of this light—and Daisy—represents the aspirational horizon that perpetually recedes, reflecting the broader societal disillusionment of the Jazz Age. The green light embodies both the tantalizing possibility of transcendence and the crushing inevitability of its elusiveness.

The Valley of Ashes, a desolate wasteland between the affluent communities of West Egg and New York, serves as a stark counterpoint to the opulence of the Jazz Age. This moral and physical landscape, dominated by the unblinking eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, underscores the spiritual decay and industrial entropy that underpin the excesses of capitalism. The eyes, silent yet omniscient, judge the moral decay of the characters and society, highlighting the disconnect between material wealth and ethical responsibility.

Gatsby’s library, with its uncut books, further critiques the performative nature of wealth and identity. The books, like Gatsby’s persona, are meticulously constructed illusions, revealing the tension between authenticity and artifice. This theme is echoed in the defunct mantelpiece clock, which symbolizes the futility of recapturing the past and the inevitability of time’s passage.

The yellow car, a symbol of opulence and excess, becomes an instrument of death, foreshadowing the tragic consequences of unchecked consumerism. The hottest day of the year serves as a metaphor for the simmering tensions beneath the characters’ polished veneer, stripping away deception and revealing raw truths. Gatsby’s death, likened to a holocaust, underscores the moral vacuity and indifference of the privileged class, critiquing the systemic failure of a society that values materialism over humanity.

Ultimately, the metaphor of boats against the current encapsulates the futility of striving against the past. The green light, once a beacon of hope, becomes an unattainable illusion, reflecting the broader disillusionment with the American Dream. Fitzgerald’s novel is a powerful indictment of the fragility of social mobility and the enduring power of class divisions, offering a haunting critique of the Jazz Age’s moral and spiritual decay.
